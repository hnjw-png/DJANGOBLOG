 BOOKING SYSTEM:

## Purpose of the Website

The purpose of the website Events101, is to give a logged-in user access to this personlised events management system. As a logged in user you should be able to a create a new reservation, update your existing reservations, and delete your own reservation. Te website should act a easy way to keep to date with your own reservations, this website is to used to personally create and keep track of your own events like inside a virtual sketchbook. You will be able to see other peoples reservations, but your will not be able to edit them. You can only be able edit your own. This site is way to share your events with your friends and keep a personal plan you can access at a click of  button. These reservations shoud be detailed, and have a clear, date, time and location. Otherwise these will be subject to deletion by the adminstrator, this is stated on the website.

# User Experience/User Interface (UX/UI)

## First Time user goals:

When the visitor first visits the reservation planning system:

* The homepage should be clear of what the websites goals are.
* When logged out/not signed up, you will see the nav bar showing, home, register, login. 
* When logging in the nav bar, will show home, create a reseveration, logout.
* The color scheme of purples, blues, whites and black splits up section of the homepage so the user can see the site is a 'Personalised Events Creation Website', there after you have  explanation of how the site works, and then a create reservation button and buttons for already uploaded reservations from all users.
* When the user is logged out and clicks the create reservation button, they will automaticalled redirected to the login/signup page.
* When the user is logged in and clicks the create reservatio button, they will be automatically be directed to the Create A Reservation Form page.
* If a user is logged out and clicks a reservation from the already existing list of reservations, they will be able to see the reservation, but will not be able to create their own reservation, or any other functionality.
* When the user is logged in, and views a reservation that another user added , they will be able to view the reservation and click the button below to create their own reservation..but they still will not be able to edit another user's reservation.
* The site should look good and function on all devices.
* You should be able to log in and log in out with no problem, you will be redirected back to the website after you logout or when you log-in just the same.
* A logged user, has full control over their own events, they can update, delete and add new reservation whenever they please.
* When the create reservation button is clicked by a logged in user, they wll redirected to the reservarion form, and there they will be able to fill out a form and add their reservaion to the database. This will be redirected to their new reservation details.
* In the future we will have a social media account and have the buttons in place, but for now they not functional.
* The website actively explains its functionality to its user. (PERSONAL NOTE: DO THIS.)

## Frequent Visitor goals:

* There should be a place where customers can log in, and logout.
* You can always see upcoming events on the homepage and that is automatically updated.
* Ability to edit, delete or a create new reservation at any time.
* There are many avenues to create a event, in various nav and buttons around the website. 


## Website owner goals:

* The owner of the site can use this site to keep track of events going on in his/her community, business etc, this is with the intention of creating a community of people who creaet and attened each other events. The owners purpose to keep the site up to date, adminsitrate and make sure the reservation posts are details enough, as well as deleting events of which the dates have gone by.
* I have used the superuser function, to create a private admin log in for the website ownwer.
* You can add a reservation as a admin user on the admin panel, this will automatically be redered onto the site.
* This site should behave like a notebook/sketbook for creating events and keeping them up to date.
* The site is intended to make it easier for the owner to keep track of bookings and avoid extra costs of using a third party booking system.
* A future function woul be a function in the admin page that gives the administrator a oppurtunity to decline bookings. Right now theres a statement on the website that if the reservation post is no detailed enough it will be deleted by admin, but in the future things like a avalible dates calender shoud be part of the system.


# Color Scheme

The colour scheme is that of a white background to keep things professional and then pops of colour in the site. The colours will be based upon more natural hues, such as:

* light purple, pink/purple hue, blue, white. Black aand purple, consistent in the homepage, follows same hues in ajoining pages. Same color coordinated with navheader and main header(the brand name event101)
* light blue, white, light purple consistent in the reservation form page and the reservation detail page and form page.
* The sign in/out and sign up page is kept to the basic allauth layout, but in the future i intend to beautify that to match the rest of the site better.

  I researched color combination and hues, to understand how to balance colors, blend them and make whats needed to stand out, stand out clearly. I like the lighter hues of color, which give th site a light friendly feel, which is consistant of the website intention to create a relaxed notebook to create events. 

  The background image is consistent on each page of the site. Its colors match the overall style of the site.

# Typography

I choose the font 'lato' this font has a nice clear look, which is a little bit like clear fancy handwriting, this stands out well and fits the style of the website, which should hae a professional feel.


# Wireframes
ADD WIREFRAMES.

## Features

# Responsiveness:

This website fits to size on all types of devices. From laptop to mobile phone. 

# Features:

## Homepage; nav-bar :

The homepage consists of a clear nav-bar which is responsive in all screen settings. The homepages nav-bar will appear differently according to if your are a logged in user or not.
When you are logged in, you will see the nav-bar names: Home, Create Reservation, Logout. When you are logged out you will see the nav-bar names: Home, Create Reservation, Register, Login.

## Homepage Header Section :

The homepage header starts with the header title 'Create a Personlised Event at Event 101!' This title is decorated with shading and multiple colors to match the overall color scheme of the website, this makes the title stand out even more...and shows the purpose of the webpage absolutely directly. The backgorund color is a simalar purple which makes the site lool very stylish and the color remains the same for the rules purpose statement below the header;
Here you have a statement about the rules and the purpose of the site more specifically. This is a friendly notice to users to keep things detailed, otherwise admin will delete the post.

Thereafter you have another section which color changes to light blue, to correlate with the websites color scheme and to make each title stand out individually.

## Homepage main page (reservations list and create reservations buttons) :

In the main page of the site, you will have a button to create a reservation, whether you're are logged in or not, you will be able to see and click this button. But if you are not logged in you wil be redirected to the login page. If you are, you will be redirected to the resveration form as previously stated. The create reservation is a bit bigger than the list of reservation button, the reason is to make it stand out. 

The reservations list buttons are also visable to a user whether they are logged in or not. When you click the reservation you will be redirected to the resveratio detail page, regarding the reservation you clicked. 

The background color is a daker pink to make the main page stand out more, it coincides with the white buttons and black, dancing script fancy font.




## Footer :

The footer is light blue, to match the rest of the site and head nav bar. There you will see who created the website (me, Holly Nicole), you will also see icons to various social media website, right now they are inactive due to no social media account for the reservation management system.



### Reservation Detail Page:

When you add a new reservation, it will render on the reservation details page, the way to access this page is to click the reservation you want to view on the homepage(reservation list). Here whilst you are logged in and accessing on of your own reservation, you will see the buttons, update reservation, delete reservation  and creat reservation.

When you are logged out, you can click any reservation from the reservation list(homepage)and you will be able to view the reservation details on the reservation detail view, but instead of seeing all the buttons as you would when your logged in, you will see the button log in below the reservation details.

The nar bar appears the same as in the homepage, deu there being all the correct templates in place, including base.html.



### Reservation form page :

The reservation form will render when you click any of the create reservation buttons on the website, whilst logged in. As well as rendering when you click the create a reservation nav button, als when logged in. The reservation form requires all fields to be filled out correctly to add the event to the homepage(database) There will be a add/submit button at the bottom of the form and if you have mis-filled in something it will inform you, it also has a default setting so the user knows ho to fill out the date and time in the form.

## Update and update button :

When you are logged in and you have selected your own reservation, the update button will appear and you will then be redirected to the Reservation form, except it will have the details of the reservation you want to edit inside it already. Then the user is free to edit the reservationd then add/save it again. And thereafter they will be redirected so they can see their updates reservation.

## Delete and delete button :

When you are logged in and you have selected your own reservation, the delete button will appear and there once you press the button your reservation will be automatically deleted. A way to improve thisin the future is the have https response message appear asking if the user is sure they want to delete.

## Create reservation button on reservation details page :

This button beahves the same as the create reservation button on the homepage, you are directed to the reservation form page.(as long as you are logged in).

## Log in, log out, sign up:

Here the automatic allauth setting has been implemented, so that we get a automatic sign in, sign out and register page, this is a basic page with redirects the user back to the website after log in or log out. To improve the system i would add  email verification system but fow now this is disabled.



## Admin page:

The admin page have all options to ad reservations, update user,

## Testing

### Django Testing

I am testing my code using the testing function in django, i am writing the code using the testcase and testing the forms.py, models.py, views.py. I am testing to check for example the title has to be filled in the form.

You want the sqlite database when testing, so comment out the one where you get the DATABASE_URL from the environment.
And make sure to reverse that when you're deploying again!

### Manual Testing

* I have tested the site as a logged in user who is the admin and everything works as intended.
* I have tested the site with a test login to see the website behaves as expected when you are a logged in user who is not a admin.
* I have tested the website while being logged out, and everything works as expected.
* Log in appears when log in button appears, when create reservation is clicked, when the user is not logged in, it redirects to log in page.
* After you are logged in you are automatically redirectd back to the website.
* When you log out you are redirected abck ot the website as well.
* Update and delete work as expected.
* Admin set up correctly, and when a reservation is added, is automatically appears in the website.




# Lighthouse: 



# CSS and HTML Validator:

## Home css validated 



# Bug fixes

* A fix would be to add a  http response when you hit the delete button, to warn the user they are deleting their reservation.

* Add email verification, so users can reaccess their accouns if passowrd is forgotten, through verification process.

*
